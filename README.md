### Under developement
🏫 I'm a Computer Science graduate student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, focused on blending my passion for development.  

💼 I’m currently working on projects ranging from portfolio optimization using real-time data to financial modeling and big data processing.  

🌱 With a strong foundation in Data Structures, Machine Learning, and Math, I am continually honing my skills in Data science, FinTech fields.  

👯 Eager to collaborate on projects that tackle real-world challenges.  

🤝 I’m always open to connect with fellow developers, data scientists, and financial professionals for collaboration/knowledge exchange.  

🏹 My goal is to bridge academic rigor and industry practice, building robust, scalable solutions that drive impactful decisions and insights.

🔭 Beyond academics, I actively explore new things in tech, especially Data science to stay updated in industry and ways to optimize real-world problems.

⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, I enjoy playing chess, math puzzles...!
